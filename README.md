## About Nibble
Nibble is a platform that connects food trucks to customers, allowing food truck owners to project their location to users and display information such as menus, reviews, and upcoming schedule to their followers. Nibble is meant to bridge the gap between food truck owners and food truck goers, who currently use ineffecient techniques such as Instagram or Twitter to broadcast their location and market to new customers.
